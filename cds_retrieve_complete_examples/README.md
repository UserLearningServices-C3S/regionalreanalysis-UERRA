# CDS forecast data retrieval examples
All data produced within the Copernicus Climate Change Service regional reanalysis for Europe and the pre-operational UERRA project are publicly available for download.

This is an example of retrieving UERRA forecast data from datasets that are not available for direct download via the [CDS web form](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-uerra-europe-complete?tab=form). 

Before running these scripts it is recommended to read the [information at the CDS website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-uerra-europe-complete?tab=form).
